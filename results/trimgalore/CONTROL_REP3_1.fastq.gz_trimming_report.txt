Trim Galore version: 0.6.7
Cutadapt version: 3.4
Python version: could not detect
Number of cores used for trimming: 4
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 16). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 0)
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Running FastQC with the following extra arguments: -t 8
Output file will be GZIP compressed
